#Learning Process
## Question 1
**What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**

It's a technique in which you first study about something and then explain it in very simple terms as if you are teaching someone else.

## Question 2
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

Not just one, in fact there were 3:
- Relaxation is very important part of learning
- If you can't hold ideas in your mind tightly that doesn't mean you lack ability to grasp but in fact you are more creative because more and more ideas are slipping in your mind
- And third and the best that I can relate to is - if you take some more time to learn there's nothing wrong with that, slow learning is not bad in fact better in many ways, it's like race car driver and a hiker going for the same destination. Both will have different experience, race car driver will reach there faster but a hiker will get to experience so much.

## Question 3
**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

- When you are concentrated and focused to solve a problem
- When you are relaxed and not intensely focused on something but in the back of mind you are thinking and solution or idea suddenly hits you

## Question 4
**According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.**

* Break any topic into smaller and smaller pieces
* Learn just enough to self correct
* Remove distractions
* Practice for 20 hours
